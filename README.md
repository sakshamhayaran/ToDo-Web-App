# 📝 ToDo Web App

A simple and modern ToDo list app built with **React**, using **Context API** for global state management and **localStorage** for data persistence. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete, all within a responsive UI styled using **Tailwind CSS**.

🔧 Key Concepts Used :-

**React Hooks**: useState, useEffect for managing and persisting todos

**Context API**: Shares todo state and actions across components

**Component-Based Architecture**: Separate components for form and todo items

**Local Storage**: Saves tasks even after page refresh

**Tailwind CSS**: Clean, responsive, and modern UI design
